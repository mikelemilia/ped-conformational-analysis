\section{Task 1}\label{sec:task1}

The goal of the first task is to implement a software to identify conformational relationships within a single ensemble. In this project we use the sructural ensamble PED00020 (measles virus nucleoprotein).
The input of this task is a file containing the PDB structure of one single PED ensemble.

\subsection{Single conformation features}
Relationships within an ensemble will be identified considering the structural features of single conformations.
First, the software extracts the single conformation features:
